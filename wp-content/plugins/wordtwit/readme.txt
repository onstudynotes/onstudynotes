WordTwit is a plugin that uses the Twitter API to automatically push a published post to your Twitter account as a tweet.

== Description ==

WordTwit keeps track of when you publish new posts, and automatically informs all followers by pushing out a Twitter tweet.  All links are automatically converted to tiny URLs to save space.  Most users see a substantial increase in blog traffic after tweeting their posts on a frequent basis.
